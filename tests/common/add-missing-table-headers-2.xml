            RAID 1+0 provides high levels of I/O performance, data redundancy,
            and disk fault tolerance. Because each member device in the RAID 0
            is mirrored individually, multiple disk failures can be tolerated
            and data remains available as long as the disks that fail are in
            different mirrors.
          </para>
          <para>
            You can optionally configure a spare for each underlying mirrored
            array, or configure a spare to serve a spare group that serves all
            mirrors.

            RAID 0+1 provides high levels of I/O performance and data
            redundancy, but slightly less fault tolerance than a 1+0. If
            multiple disks fail on one side of the mirror, then the other mirror
            is available. However, if disks are lost concurrently on both sides
            of the mirror, all data is lost.
          </para>
          <para>
            This solution offers less disk fault tolerance than a 1+0 solution,
            but if you need to perform maintenance or maintain the mirror on a
            different site, you can take an entire side of the mirror offline
            and still have a fully functional storage device. Also, if you lose
            the connection between the two sites, either site operates
            independently of the other. That is not true if you stripe the
            mirrored segments, because the mirrors are managed at a lower level.
          </para>
          <para>
            If a device fails, the mirror on that side fails because RAID 1 is
            not fault-tolerant. Create a new RAID 0 to replace the failed side,
            then resynchronize the mirrors.
