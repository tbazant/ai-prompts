From the attached CSV list, create a playlists of electronic dance music (EDM).

* each line represents a Maxi single LP and has the following information: author, title, musical style, winner track of the LP, and remaining tracks of the LP
* the structure is explained on the example of line 'Antiloop,In My Mind,Trance,LG1: In My Mind ★★★ 33/138,LG2: Chamber Of Snd Dub ★★★ 33/136,B1: Poor Mind Alteration ★★★ 33/136,B2: Mind Ya Own Business ★★★ 33/142'
  - 'Antiloop' is the author of the single
  - 'In My Mind' is the LP title
  - 'Trance' is the musical style
  - the winner (= the best for me) track is on the 'LG1' position of the LP, it is called 'In My Mind' and has a rating of 3 black stars (=the best), and has BPM 131 (the number after slash)
  - the second good track is on the 'LG2' position, it is called 'Chamber Of Snd Dub', has also 3 black stars and BPM of 136
* use only the tracks from the attached CSV list, do not add external tracks
* each playlist will include 10 tracks
* include only the tracks with 3-black-star rating ★★★, not ★★☆ nor ★☆☆
* distribute all tracks across the playlists
* tracks must be unique between playlists
* make transition between tracks smooth by placing tracks with similar BPM next to each other
* start a playlist with slower tracks and gradually build the energy, then slow into a chill
