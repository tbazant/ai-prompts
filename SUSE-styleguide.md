# Task
Revise the current file (or selected text) where any of the below rules are not respected or the meaning is not clear.

# Language
* Write using American English spelling and grammar conventions. This means using spellings like "color" instead of "colour" and "organize" instead of "organise."
* Favor "-ize" spellings. Use "organize," "realize," etc., rather than "-ise" spellings.
* Do not use contractions. Write "do not" instead of "don't," "it is" instead of "it's," and so on.
* Minimize the use of possessive forms. Instead of "the car's engine," prefer "the engine of the car" or a phrasing that avoids the possessive entirely.
* Use the simple present tense. Describe actions and states as they generally or habitually occur. For example, use "The system processes data" instead of "The system is processing data" or "The system will process data."

# Content
* Maintain the full technical depth and context of the original content with the LIX readability grade 40-45
* Each concept from the source material must be present in the revised version.

# Structure
* Prioritize clarity and conciseness in sentence structure, maintaining natural sentence complexity and flow.
* Avoid excessively short, choppy sentences that disrupt the flow of information.
* Split or simplify sentences longer than 25 words.
* End sentences with a period and eliminate any instances of souble spaces between sentences.
* Do not join sentences with semicolons.

# Tone
* Maintain an explanatory and professional tone.
* Address the reader as "you".
* Prefer active voice.
* Start recommendations with "We recommend".

# Acronyms
* Define acronyms at first use. Place the definition in parentheses after the acronym.
* Do not use both an acronym and its expansion in headings.
* Form plural acronyms by adding a lowercase "s".

# Commas
* Be mindful of comma usage before 'and' in lists. Do NOT use a comma before 'and' if the list items are single words. Specifically, avoid constructions like 'A, B, and C'. Instead, use 'A, B and C'.
* Use commas around phrases like "for example" or "that is".  Use a comma after introductory phrases.

# Colons
* Capitalize the first word after a colon only if it is a proper noun or the beginning of a complete sentence.

# Headings
* Capitalize only the first word of a heading.
* Use noun-based headings for descriptive sections.
* Use gerund-based headings for task-oriented sections.

# Numbers
* Spell out numbers zero through nine. Use numerals for 10 and above.
* Always use numerals with abbreviated units. Insert a non-breaking space between the number and the unit.

# DocBook-related
* Keep line breaks at column 80.
* Do not resolve XML entities, keep them.
* Do not update the content of the <screen/> element.
* Preserve all technical options, commands, parameters or links enclosed in <literal/>, <option/>, <filename/>, <command/>, <replaceable/>, <link/> or <xref/> elements.
