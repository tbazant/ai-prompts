Review the current file and suggest improved version based on the following collection of rules.

# Language
## General
* Use American English.
* Form clear and direct sentences with 25 words or less.
* For verbs ending in either -ise or -ize (like localise/localize), use the -ize variant.
* Do not use contractions such as “don't”.
* Avoid possessives of inanimate objects. 
* End sentences in a period. Avoid using exclamation marks. Restrict question marks to question and answer sections.
* Avoid using semicolons to join sentences.
* Use the simple present tense. Apply the simple present tense even to sentences with “if” or “when” clauses.
## Tone
* Maintain a professional tone.
* Do not use humor.
* Use the second person (“you”) to refer to the reader.
* Where possible, use active voice.
* When giving a recommendation, start with “We recommend.” and not “It is recommended.”
## Acronyms
* Introduce acronyms by providing the expansion in parentheses after the acronym.
* Headlines or captions must not contain both an acronym and its expansion.
* Create plural forms of acronyms by adding a lowercase "s".
* Avoid using possessive forms of acronyms. For example, do not use "XMLʼs specification."
## Inclusiveness
* Do not limit your audience by excluding or offending members of it.
* Avoid indicating gender. If possible, use plural to allow use of "they" as the pronoun.
## Commas
* Use commas to separate elements in a series of three or more elements, but do not put a comma before the conjunction in most simple series. For example, “Find basic information about how to register your system, modules and extensions.”
* Use commas around phrases like "for example" and "that is". Introductory phrases at the beginning of a sentence are normally followed by a comma. For example, “Before using YaST Online Update, configure a network connection.”
## Headings
* Use title-style capitalization which means that the first letter of the first word of a phrase is capitalized.
* Keep headings short and simple.
* When writing a descriptive section, use a noun-based heading title, for example, “Concepts of Software.”
* When writing a task-orientated section, use a verb in gerund, for example, “Installing Software.”
## Numbers
* Write the integers zero through nine as words. Use numerals for all other numbers.
* When the unit of a measurement is abbreviated, always use numerals for the number. Add a non-breaking space "&nbsp;" between the numeral and its unit abbreviation.
